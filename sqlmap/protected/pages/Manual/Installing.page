<h1>Installing the DataMapper for PHP</h1>

<p>This section explains how to install, configure, and use the SQLMap DataMapper
with your PHP application.</p>

<p>There are two steps to using SQLMap DataMapper with your application for the
first time.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Setup the distribution</li>
  <li>Add XML documents</li>
</ol>

<h2>Setup the Distribution</h2>

<p>The official site for SQLMap PHP DataMapper is <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado">https://github.com/pradosoft/prado</a>. 
The DataMapper
is availabe as a source distribution in the form of a ZIP archive. To download
the distributions, follow the link to the Downloads area on the web site, and
select the the source distribution for the SQLMap PHP DataMapper release. You
can extract the distribution using a utility like WinZip or the extractor
built into newer versions of Windows.</p>

<p><b>TODO: Add distribution contents</b></p>

<h1>Add XML file items</h1>
<p>After unpacking the source distribution, you will need to add two types of XML
files to your Web application, or library project (and Test project if you
have one). These files are:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>SqlMap.xml</dt>
    <dd>--  A Data Map file that contains your SQL queries. Your project will contain one
  or more of these files with names such as Account.xml or Product.xml.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SqlMap.config</dt>
    <dd>--
    The DataMapper configuration file that is used to specify the locations of your
    SqlMap.xml files. It is also used to define other DataMapper
   configuration options such as caching. You will need to include one SqlMap.config
   file for each data source that your project has.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
<p>As expected, the <tt>SqlMap.config</tt> file should be (by default) placed where the DataMapper
can find them at runtime.</p>
