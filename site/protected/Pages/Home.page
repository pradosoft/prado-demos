      <h3>Prado 4.3.0 has been released!</h3>
      <span class="date">October 26, 2023</span>
      <p>This new release introduces a lot of new features and compatibility changes baked during the last year.</p>
      <p>The required minimum Php version has been raised to 8.1; if you're still running php 7.x you should really consider upgrading, but in the meanwhile Prado 4.2.x will keep serving you well.</p>
      <p>A big thank to <a href="https://github.com/belisoful">@belisoful</a> that worked hard to consolidate two basic aspects of prado: data type classes (TList/TMap/...) and behaviors, and also found the time to add some new goodies like an integrated PHP Web Server Action for built-in app development.</p>
      <p>As always, before upgrading you may want to have a read at HISTORY.md to see what has changed in details and UPGRADE.md to check if your application needs any modification to run on this new Prado version.</p>

      <h3>Prado 4.2.2 is available!</h3>
      <span class="date">April 6, 2023</span>
      <p>This is mainly a bug-fix and compatibility release.</p>
      <p>
        The minimum required PHP version has been raised from 7.3 to 7.4. While this should be a simple update, please remember that PHP 7 is EOL (end of life), so you should consider upgrading to PHP 8.x as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason this would probably be the last Prado version supporting PHP 7, as new development will only target PHP 8 from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thanks to all the developers who contributed to this release, in particular we'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/belisoful">@belisoful</a> for his continuous effort in implementing new features and keeping them updated.
      </p>
      <p>Users are advised to update from 4.2.1, as it should require no code changes.</p>
      <p>Happy coding!</p>

      <p>This is mainly a bug-fix and compatibility release.</p>
      <p>
        Support for using active controls on PHP 7.3  has been restored, even if you should probably consider upgrading to a more recent PHP version.
        <br/>
        A severe bug was found when using custom authorization rules, and this one has been corrected, too.

      This new release introduces a lot of new features and compatibility changes baked during the last year.
      <br>The required minimum Php version has been raised to 7.3, and supports Php up to version 8.1.
      <br>A big thank to @belisoful that reworked some of the core code to introduce most of the new features, just to name a few:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>TPermissionsManager, implements Role Based Access Control and Authorization Rules for each permission <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/790">#790</a></li>
       <li>TCronModule and TDbCronModule, scheduler like linux cron schedule expression <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/761">#761</a></li>
       <li>TPluginModule/TDbPluginModule, Integrate Composer extensions for PRADO <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/743">#743</a></li>
       <li>TDbParameterModule for reading and setting application parameters with a database-table <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/771">#771</a></li>
       <li>Complete rewrite of Prado-CLI <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/765">#765</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/783">#783</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Also, the behavior / event system got a big overhaul, with the addition of new classes to manage behaviors (TBehaviorsModule, TBehaviorParameterLoader <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/741">#741</a>), the creation of a set of builtin behaviors and more fixes and enhancements all around.
