      <h3>Prado 4.1.1 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">March 27, 2020</span>
      <p>Prado 4.1.1 is available!
      <br>This is mainly a bug-fix and compatibility release, and it add support for running Prado applications using Php 7.4.</p>
      <p>Some work has been made to modernize the code, removing the usage of tags and attributes not officially supported in html5; this resulted in the deprecation of a few methods, where newer alternatives are now available.
      <p>As always, before upgrading you may want to have a read at the <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/blob/master/UPGRADE.md">UPGRADE.md</a> instructions to check what has changed in details.</p>

      <h3>Prado 4.1.0 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">November 18, 2019</span>
      <p>Prado 4.1.0 is available!
      <br>This release is 100% compatible with existing code running on Prado 4.0.x, and a few minor fixes are included aswell.</p>
      <p>The biggest change in this new version is that it requires at least Php 7.1 in order to run; later versions are supported and tested aswell.
      <br>If you're still running applications based on Php 5, you should really consider upgrading. Php 5 is officially <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">out of support</a> since an year ago, and Php 7 is a really solid upgrade in terms of speed and features.</p>
      <p>As always, before upgrading you may want to have a read at the <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/blob/master/UPGRADE.md">UPGRADE.md</a> instructions to check what has changed in details.</p>

      <h3>Prado 4.0.2 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">April 12, 2019</span>
      <p>Prado 4.0.2 is available! This is release includes some important fixes and introduces the usage of php's <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/intro.intl.php">intl</a> extension for a better handling of international formatting of localized assets like numbers, dates and currencies.<br/>
        As always, before upgrading you may want to have a read at the <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/blob/master/UPGRADE.md">UPGRADE.md</a> instructions to check what has changed in details.<br/>
        With PHP 5 not being <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">officially supported</a> anymore and the fast development schedule of PHP bringing in awesome new features at each release, the future development will focus on supporting PHP versions from 7.1.<br><br>

      <h3>Prado 4.0.1 is available</h3>
      <span class="date">April 1, 2018</span>
      <p>This is not an April Fools joke! This is mostly a bugfix release, and it contains an important fix for active controls when running under the recently released php version 7.2 (see issue <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/663">#663</a> for further details).<br/>
        The minimum required php version is now 5.4, in order to support some useful features like the short array syntax. Anyway, you may want to stick with a supported php version like 5.6 or preferably at least 7.1.<br/>
        If you are still using one of the Prototypejs based controls (eg. TAutoComplete, TDraggable) or any other deprecated feature, you may want to have a read at the <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/blob/master/UPGRADE.md">UPGRADE.md</a> instructions before updating in order to find a replacement.<br/>
        Last but not least, a big overhaul took place on the code an the documentation blocks to make them more consistent.<br><br>
        We hope you'll enjoy coding with this new version as usual!
      <br>Happy coding!<br><br>

      <h3>Prado 4.0.0 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">November 20, 2017</span>
      <p>The PRADO Group is proud to announce the formal release of <span style="font-weight:bold">PRADO 4.0.0</span>.<br><br>Prado4 is a long-time overdue update to support php's new features, <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/" >PSR's standards</a> and loading external libraries using <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>.
        <br>Such a big change required a lot of testing to ensure a stable behaviour. Still, the main goal was to be fully backwards compatible with existing applications, requiring little to none effort to port them to the new Prado version.
        <br><br>We hope you enjoy working with the new version: happy coding!
