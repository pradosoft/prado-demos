      <h3>Prado 4.2.0 has been released!</h3>
      <span class="date">April 19, 2022</span>
      <p>
      This new release introduces a lot of new features and compatibility changes baked during the last year.
      <br>The required minimum Php version has been raised to 7.3, and supports Php up to version 8.1.
      <br>A big thank to @belisoful that reworked some of the core code to introduce most of the new features, just to name a few:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>TPermissionsManager, implements Role Based Access Control and Authorization Rules for each permission <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/790">#790</a></li>
       <li>TCronModule and TDbCronModule, scheduler like linux cron schedule expression <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/761">#761</a></li>
       <li>TPluginModule/TDbPluginModule, Integrate Composer extensions for PRADO <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/743">#743</a></li>
       <li>TDbParameterModule for reading and setting application parameters with a database-table <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/771">#771</a></li>
       <li>Complete rewrite of Prado-CLI <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/765">#765</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/783">#783</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Also, the behavior / event system got a big overhaul, with the addition of new classes to manage behaviors (TBehaviorsModule, TBehaviorParameterLoader <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/741">#741</a>), the creation of a set of builtin behaviors and more fixes and enhancements all around.

      <h3>Prado 4.1.0 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">November 18, 2019</span>
      <p>Prado 4.1.0 is available!
      <br>This release is 100% compatible with existing code running on Prado 4.0.x, and a few minor fixes are included aswell.</p>
      <p>The biggest change in this new version is that it requires at least Php 7.1 in order to run; later versions are supported and tested aswell.</p>
      <br>If you're still running applications based on Php 5, you should really consider upgrading. Php 5 is officially <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">out of support</a> since an year ago, and Php 7 is a really solid upgrade in terms of speed and features.</p>

      <h3>Prado 4.0.2 is released</h3>
      <span class="date">April 12, 2019</span>
      <p>Prado 4.0.2 is available! This is release includes some important fixes and introduces the usage of php's <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/intro.intl.php">intl</a> extension for a better handling of international formatting of localized assets like numbers, dates and currencies.<br/>

        With PHP 5 not being <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">officially supported</a> anymore and the fast development schedule of PHP bringing in awesome new features at each release, the future development will focus on supporting PHP versions from 7.1.<br><br>

      <h3>Prado 4.0.1 is available</h3>
      <span class="date">April 1, 2018</span>
      <p>This is not an April Fools joke! This is mostly a bugfix release, and it contains an important fix for active controls when running under the recently released php version 7.2 (see issue <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/issues/663">#663</a> for further details).<br/>
        The minimum required php version is now 5.4, in order to support some useful features like the short array syntax. Anyway, you may want to stick with a supported php version like 5.6 or preferably at least 7.1.<br/>
        If you are still using one of the Prototypejs based controls (eg. TAutoComplete, TDraggable) or any other deprecated feature, you may want to have a read at the <a href="https://github.com/pradosoft/prado/blob/master/UPGRADE.md">UPGRADE.md</a> instructions before updating in order to find a replacement.<br/>
        Last but not least, a big overhaul took place on the code an the documentation blocks to make them more consistent.<br><br>
        We hope you'll enjoy coding with this new version as usual!
