<h1>TKeyboard</h1>
<com:DocLink ClassPath="Prado.Web.UI.WebControls.TKeyboard" />

<p class="block-content">
<tt>TKeyboard</tt> displays a virtual keyboard that users can click on to enter input in
an associated text box. It helps to reduce the keyboard recording hacking.
</p>

<p class="block-content">
To use TKeyboard, write a template like following:
</p>
<com:TTextHighlighter Language="prado" CssClass="source block-content">
&lt;com:TTextBox ID="PasswordInput" />
&lt;com:TKeyboard ForControl="PasswordInput" />
</com:TTextHighlighter>

<p class="block-content">
A TKeyboard control is associated with a <tt>TTextBox</tt> control by specifying
<tt>ForControl</tt> to be the ID of that control. When the textbox is in focus,
a virtual keyboard will pop up; and when the text box is losing focus, the keyboard
will hide automatically. Set <tt>AutoHide</tt> to false to keep the keyboard showing all the time.
</p>

<p class="block-content">
The appearance of the keyboard can also be changed by specifying a customized CSS file via
<tt>CssUrl</tt>. By default, the CSS class name for the keyboard is 'Keyboard'. This may
also be changed by specifying <tt>KeyboardCssClass</tt>
