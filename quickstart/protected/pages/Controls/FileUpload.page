<p class="block-content">
<tt>TFileUpload</tt> displays a file upload field on a Web page. Upon postback, the text entered into the field will be treated as the (local) name of the file that is uploaded to the server.
</p>
<p class="block-content">
<tt>TFileUpload</tt> raises an <tt>OnFileUpload</tt> event when it is post back. The property <tt>HasFile</tt> indicates whether the file upload is successful or not. If successful, the uploaded file may be saved on the server by calling <tt>saveAs()</tt> method.
</p>
<p class="block-content">
The following properties give the information about the uploaded file:
</p>
<ul id="u1" class="block-content">
  <li><tt>FileName</tt> - the original client-side file name without directory information.</li>
  <li><tt>FileType</tt> - the MIME type of the uploaded file.</li>
  <li><tt>FileSize</tt> - the file size in bytes.</li>
  <li><tt>LocalName</tt> - the absolute file path of the uploaded file on the server. Note, this file will be deleted after the current page request is completed. Call <tt>saveAs()</tt> to save the uploaded file.</li>
</ul>
<p class="block-content">
If the file upload is unsuccessful, the property <tt>ErrorCode</tt> gives the error code describing the cause of failure. See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php">PHP documentation</a> for a complete explanation of the possible error codes.
