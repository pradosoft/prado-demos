<p class="block-content">
<tt>TMultiView</tt> serves as a container for a group of <tt>TView</tt> controls, which can be retrieved by the <tt>Views</tt> property. Each view contains child controls. <tt>TMultiView</tt> determines which view and its child controls are visible. At any time, at most one view is visible (called <i>active</i>). To make a view active, set <tt>ActiveView</tt> or <tt>ActiveViewIndex</tt>. Note, by default there is no active view.

<p class="block-content">
To add a view to <tt>TMultiView</tt>, manipulate the <tt>Views</tt> collection or add it in template as follows,

   &lt;com:TView&gt;

<p class="block-content">
<tt>TMultiView</tt> responds to the following command events to manage the visibility of its views.
</p>
<ul id="u1" class="block-content">
  <li><tt>NextView</tt> : switch to the next view (with respect to the currently active view).
  <li><tt>PreviousView</tt> : switch to the previous view (with respect to the currently active view).
  <li><tt>SwitchViewID</tt> : switch to a view by its ID path. The ID path is fetched from the command parameter.
  <li><tt>SwitchViewIndex</tt> : switch to a view by its zero-based index in the <tt>Views</tt> collection. The index is fetched from the command parameter.
</ul>

<p class="block-content">
Upon postback, if the active view index is changed, <tt>TMultiView</tt> will raise an <tt>OnActiveViewChanged</tt> event.
