<p class="block-content">
<tt>TLabel</tt> displays a piece of text on a Web page. The text to be displayed is set via its <tt>Text</tt> property. If <tt>Text</tt> is empty, content enclosed within the <tt>TLabel</tt> component tag will be displayed. <tt>TLabel</tt> may also be used as a form label associated with some control on the form. Since <tt>Text</tt> is not HTML-encoded when being rendered, make sure it does not contain dangerous characters that you want to avoid.
