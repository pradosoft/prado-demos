PRADO is an event-driven and component-based framework
for Web application development in PHP 5.

Components following the PRADO protocol are highly
configurable and reusable. Properties defining
the basic features of a component can be configured 
in specifications, templates or code. 
New components can be developed by either inheriting
an existing component class or composing several
components together. The work of using a component 
amounts to placing the component tag on the page template, 
configuring component properties, and writing handler 
functions to respond to component events.

PRADO shares many similarities with ASP.NET and other
RAD tools for Windows GUI development, such as Borland Delphi.
In particular, it supports event-driven programming,
viewstate maintenance, javascript, template, form validations, etc.
