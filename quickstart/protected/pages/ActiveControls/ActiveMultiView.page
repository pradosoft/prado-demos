<p class="block-content">
<tt>TActiveMultiView</tt> is the active counterpart to the original <tt>TMultiView</tt> control.
<tt>TActiveMultiView</tt> serves as a container for a group of <tt>TView</tt> controls, which can be retrieved by the <tt>Views</tt> property. Each view contains child controls. <tt>TActiveMultiView</tt> determines which view and its child controls are visible. At any time, at most one view is visible (called <i>active</i>). To make a view active, set <tt>ActiveView</tt> or <tt>ActiveViewIndex</tt>. Note, by default there is no active view.
<tt>TActiveMultiView</tt> is able to render itself on Callback when <tt>ActiveView</tt> or <tt>ActiveViewIndex</tt> properties are changed.
