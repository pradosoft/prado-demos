<p class="block-content">
<tt>TActiveFileUpload</tt> displays a file upload field on a page. Upon postback,
the text entered into the field will be treated as the name of the file
that will be uploaded to the server. The property <tt>HasFile</tt>
indicates whether the file upload is successful. If successful, the file
may be obtained by calling<tt>saveAs</tt> to save it at a specified place.
You can use <tt>FileName</tt>, <tt>FileType</tt>,
<tt>FileSize</tt> to get the original client-side file name,
the file mime type, and the file size information. If the upload is not
successful, <tt>ErrorCode</tt> contains the error code
describing the cause of failure.
</p>

<p class="block-content">
TActiveFileUpload raises <tt>OnFileUpload</tt> event if a file is uploaded
(whether it succeeds or not).
</p>

<p class="block-content">
TActiveFileUpload actually does a postback in a hidden IFrame, and then does a callback.
This callback then raises the <tt>OnFileUpload</tt> event. After the postback
a status icon is displayed; either a green checkmark if the upload is successful,
or a red x if there was an error.
