            <li>Optionally generate all relationships in Active Record Classes.</li>
            <li>Generate the magic __toString() method in all AR Classes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p class="block-content">
        To use WSAT, you need to install it using composer:

    <com:TTextHighlighter CssClass="source block-content">
    composer require pradosoft/prado-wsat
    </com:TTextHighlighter>
    Then add in your project configuration file: <tt>application.xml</tt>,
    in the services section the wsat service like follows:

<com:TTextHighlighter CssClass="source block-content" Language="xml">
<services> 
    ...
    <service id="wsat" class="System.Wsat.TWsatService" Password="my_secret_password" />
</services>
</com:TTextHighlighter>
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p class="block-content">
